# Hotwire for Rails [Deprecated]

This gem was aggregating the dependencies of Turbo and Stimulus, but offered nothing else. Aggregating dependencies is not enough value, so this gem is now deprecated. Please use the underlying frameworks directly. See https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails and https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus-rails
